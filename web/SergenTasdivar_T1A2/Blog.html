            <p>As per the Gartner glossary, cybersecurity is the combination of people, policies, processes and technologies employed by an enterprise to protect its cyber assets. Cybersecurity is optimized to levels that business leaders define, balancing the resources required with usability/manageability and the amount of risk offset. Subsets of cybersecurity include IT security, IoT security, information security and OT security.</p>
            <p>The past year brought about many challenges for business continuity but it also led organizations to explore a more resilient, adaptable form of business that would ensure desired outcomes in both calm times and turmoil.</p>

            <img src="images/Blockchain-blog.webp" alt="Blockchain blog post image">
            <p>Blockchain technology makes it possible for two or more parties to exchange value in digital environments without having an intermediary validating the transaction. Like the internet once did for business, blockchain is a paradigm shift that enables entirely new opportunities.</p>
            <p>Although the blockchain technology landscape can be confusing and is constantly changing, it is a technology that is almost certain to impact the business of most IT leaders in the next five years. Whether due to the adoption of blockchain by a competitor or the necessity to participate in a blockchain network, you can’t afford to ignore this powerful technology.</p>

            <img src="images/Communicate-blog.jpg" alt="Communicate blog post image" >
            <p>To build a compelling business value story, leading CIOs start by understanding business leader priorities. By focusing on the business goals, outcomes and pain points of their business stakeholders, rather than the underlying technology, they are able to elevate the business value of IT conversation.</p>
            <p>CIOs should become the central agent in demonstrating the business value of IT and ensure IT’s credibility within the organization. They too often focus on technology and operational performance metrics that bore business leaders and fail to convey IT’s value to the business.</p>

            <p>Digital transformation is a top priority for CEOs and boards of directors in an effort to create a connected platform and new industry revenue streams. Executive leaders need to approach strategy in a manner that recognizes the differences between transformation and business optimization.</p>
            <p>Digital transformation tends to span a mid- to long-term planning horizon and needs calibration and continuous learning. The three planning horizons of Gartner’s Strategic Planning Framework defines the three steps to complete transformation.</p>
